## Technical Test
### 1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
It took me 3 days to complete the assignment due to work and personal commitments. If I had more time, I would add SSL and implement a highly available Jenkins-Slave configuration to my code.
Also, I would have added Ingress Rules to access Jenkins externally.

### 2. Why did you choose the language you used for the coding test?
I chose YAML to write scripts for Ansible and Kubernetes because it is simpler to use and work with when compared to other data formats like JSON or XML. Moreover, there are libraries available in most programming languages for working with YAML. It does the job and executes the instructions I write and it is easy to understand.

### 3. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language?
In YAML version 1.2, edition 3,  boolean values may be serialized as “true” or “false”; the empty scalar as “null”.

### 4. Please describe yourself using JSON or YAML.
In YAML,
```YAML
